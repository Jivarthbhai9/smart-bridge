### **Script to Explain the Smart Bridge Project**

---

**Introduction**  
"Hello everyone, today I will present our innovative project, the **Smart Bridge**. This bridge is designed to adjust its height dynamically based on water levels, ensuring safety and adaptability during flooding situations."

---

**Purpose**  
"The purpose of this project is to create a bridge that can maintain a consistent clearance of **7 cm** above the water level. This feature is crucial for areas prone to flooding, as it allows the bridge to remain operational and safe during extreme conditions."

---

**Components**  
"Let me first walk you through the components we used to build this project:  
1. **Arduino UNO** - The brain of our system, responsible for processing data and controlling the servos.  
2. **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** - Measures the water level in real time.  
3. **Servo Motors (4)** - Adjust the bridge's height by controlling its support structures.  
4. **External Power Supply** - Provides sufficient power to the servo motors.  
5. **Bridge Structure** - A lightweight model designed to demonstrate the height adjustment.  
6. **Wires and Connectors** - For connecting all the components together."

**Working Principle**  
"Here’s how the Smart Bridge works:  
1. The **ultrasonic sensor** continuously measures the distance between the bridge and the water surface.  
2. The **Arduino UNO** processes the sensor data and calculates the required height adjustment.  
3. Four **servo motors** are used to lift or lower the bridge, ensuring uniform height adjustment across all sides.  
4. The bridge is designed to maintain a clearance of **7 cm** from the water surface, dynamically adapting to rising or falling water levels."

---

**Demonstration**  
"Now let’s see the Smart Bridge in action:  
1. As the water level rises, the ultrasonic sensor detects the change.  
2. The Arduino UNO processes this data and sends signals to the servo motors.  
3. The servo motors lift the bridge to maintain a consistent clearance of 7 cm.  
4. Similarly, when the water level drops, the bridge lowers itself to match the target distance."

---

**Applications**  
"This project has various real-world applications:  
1. **Flood-Prone Areas** - Ensures safe passage during floods.  
2. **Smart Infrastructure** - Contributes to the development of smart cities.  
3. **Temporary Bridges** - Ideal for emergency and disaster relief situations."

---

**Conclusion**  
"The Smart Bridge is a practical and innovative solution to tackle challenges posed by fluctuating water levels. It’s cost-effective, easy to implement, and can be scaled for real-world applications. Thank you!"
