Here’s a list of all the components required for building your **Smart Bridge** project with Arduino UNO and servos:

---

### **Required Components**
1. **Arduino UNO**  
   - Acts as the controller for the servos and ultrasonic sensor.

2. **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**  
   - Measures the water level beneath the bridge.  
   - Connections: **TRIG → Pin 7**, **ECHO → Pin 6**

3. **Servos (x4)**  
   - To adjust the height of the bridge.  
   - Example: SG90, MG996R, or any compatible servo motor.  
   - Connections: **Servo pins → Pins 9, 10, 11, 12**

4. **Servo Power Supply**  
   - External power supply (e.g., 5V 2A power adapter or a battery pack) for powering the servos.  
   - Do not power the servos directly from the Arduino UNO, as it cannot provide sufficient current.

5. **Power Distribution Board (Optional)**  
   - If using multiple servos, a power distribution board can help manage the power connections efficiently.

6. **Wires and Connectors**  
   - Jumper wires (male-to-male, male-to-female) for connections.

7. **Breadboard (Optional)**  
   - Useful for connecting and testing components.

8. **Power Supply for Arduino UNO**  
   - USB cable or external power source (e.g., 9V battery or power adapter).

9. **Mounting Hardware**  
   - Materials to attach the servos to the bridge structure, such as brackets, screws, and double-sided tape.

10. **Bridge Structure**  
    - A lightweight model to simulate the bridge. You can use wood, plastic, or cardboard.

11. **External Power Source for the Ultrasonic Sensor (Optional)**  
    - If you notice instability in measurements, provide a separate 5V supply for the sensor.

12. **Tools for Assembly**  
    - Screwdrivers, hot glue gun, soldering iron (if required).

### **Circuit Diagram**
- The servos connect to the Arduino UNO's PWM pins (9, 10, 11, 12) and an external power source.
- The ultrasonic sensor connects to the UNO's digital pins (7 for TRIG, 6 for ECHO).
- The Arduino UNO is powered through its USB port or an external source.

---

### **Power Management Tips**
- Use a stable external power source for the servos (e.g., 6V battery pack or 5V 2A power supply).
- Share a common ground between the Arduino UNO and the external servo power supply.
- For long-term or high-power setups, consider using a voltage regulator module to step down voltage safely.
